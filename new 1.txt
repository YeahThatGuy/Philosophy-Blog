Dear Readers,

This website centres around the ancient wisdom left to us by Greek philosophers.
Their reflections and observations are still as relevant today, as they were at the time of their creation. 

In this community, you can review books focused on Ancient Greek philosophy. You are also encouraged to make recommendations for your fellow members. If you feel like reflecting, then you can leave a custom essay under the "Opinions" category. We also provide the option to exchange books. Check the "Offers" section for this service.

Kind regards,
Christian
